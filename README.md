# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Summary:
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientis Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to apply the data engineering skills learned in the course to analyze disaster data to build a model that classifies disaster messages. 

The project is divided in three sections:
1. Data Processing: build an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) Pipeline to extract data from the given dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database.
2. Machine Learning Pipeline: split the data into a training set and a test set. Then, create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that predicts a message classifications for the 36 categories (multi-output classification).
3. Web development develop a web application to show classify messages in real time.

### Libraries & Installations:
- Python Version 3.6.3
- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- sklearn
- sqlalchemy

A full list of requirements can be found under the requirements.txt file. 
To install all Python packages written in the requirements.txt file run pip install -r requirements.txt.

### Files:
There are three main folders in this project:
- data
- models
- app

Data contains the "process_data.py" script which reads in the "disaster_categories/messages.csv" files, cleans them and stores them into a sqlite database called "DisasterResponse.db".

Models contains the train_classifier.py script which use the "DisasterResponse.db" to load itÂ´s data. Additionally it sets up a ML pipeline, fits and evaluates the model and saves it to a picke "classifier.pkl" file in the end. 

App contains the "run.py" script which sets up the website, the visualizations and the server.

### Instructions:
Since the "classifier.pkl" is too large to upload, you have to train you own model using the provided code, you can start at step 2 (beware it will take some time to train the model).

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model:
    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
        
2. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model:
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`
        
3. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

4. Run your web app: `python run.py`

Using the web app:
1. Write the message you want to have classified into the text field 
2. Click "Classify Message" 
3. Check out the results (resulting categories will be highlited green)
